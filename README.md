# Node APNG

A Node library for stitching `Buffer`s containing PNG image data together to
form an APNG image.

This repository contains an example animated image. It is uploaded with both
the APNG and the PNG extension. GitHub will display image preview only for
the variant with the PNG extension when accessing the file directly.

When embedded in MarkDown, such as in this readme, both extensions work as
image sources. Here's the APNG variant as an image source:
